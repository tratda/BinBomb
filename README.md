# BinBomb
Binary Bomb Files for USMA SIGSAC meeting 08FEB2016

The binary bomb is the classic introduction to reverse engineering. The Binary Bomb contains a series of phases that are designed to challenge and overwhem the user. The objective of this Binary Bomb is to provide a safe and practical way to conduct reversing in a scalable method. A benefit of this as a lab is that all users regardless of skill levels can be engaged at a level that each user finds challenging.
